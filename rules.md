## characters
 - the minimal unit is a consonant-vowel pair.
 - each consonant-vowel pair is represented by one character.
 - each character can be pronounced in only one way.
 - the pseudo-silent consonants and vowels are represented with the null half-character "-".
 - each primary consonant and vowel can have modifications, forming secondary consonants and vowels.
 - no character should sound too much like any other.
 - ideally, as many vocal sounds should be representable as one or more linear combinations of characters as possible.

## expressions
 - ideally, only irreducible non-compound concepts should have single-character representations.
 - if a concept can be reduced to (is a compound of) two or more concepts, it should be expressed as a concatenation of the expressions for those concepts.
 - unambiguous shortenings of compound expressions are acceptable.
