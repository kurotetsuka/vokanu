## Characters
 - the minimal unit is a consonant-vowel pair.
 - each consonant-vowel pair is represented by one character.
 - the pseudo-silent consonants and vowels are represented with the "null half-character '-'.
 - each primary consonant and vowel can have modifications, forming secondary consonants and vowels.
 - each character can be pronounced in one way only.
 - every sound has only one character.
 - sounds that are difficult to pronounce will not be included.
 - characters cannot indicate pitch
 - ideally, as many human vocal sounds should be representable as one or more linear combinations of characters as is possible.

## Expressions
 - ideally, only irreducible non-compound concepts should have single-character representations.
 - if a concept can be reduced to (is a compound of) two or more concepts, it should be expressed as a concatenation of the expressions for those concepts.
 - unambiguous shortenings of compound expressions are acceptable.
 - expressions that modify expressions (adjectives or adverbs) prefix them. 
 - when concatenating expressions, the more general expressions go ahead of the more specific ones.
